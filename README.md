# RustyTracer
This is a pet project to test the waters with rust and ray tracing! So far, things are going great, but there's still lots to do.

# Todo Items
- ✔️ Add support for non-axis aligned bounding boxes 
- Add support for world transformations
- ✔️ Add support for rendering to the window (Done with pixels 0.0.4 & winit)
- Vectorize computations using OpenCL arrayfire (Might not be worth it bc of memory move costs)
- Add collision detection for world objects
