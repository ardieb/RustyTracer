# RustyTracer
This is a pet project to test the water of rust and ray tracing! So far, things are going great, but there's still lots to do.

# Todo Items
- Add support for non-axis aligned bounding boxes
- Add support for world transformations
- Add support for rendering to the window (Candidate tech is arrayfire rust wrapper)
- Vectorize computations using OpenCL arrayfire
- Add collision detection for world objects
